From the assignment page:
"Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the codebooks
available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries
you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?"


I'm not sure what this means, but I'm going to do my best to impress upon you
that I made a serious effort to try to interpret it, and to submit a codebook
that falls into this interpretation.
Here is a list of the columns and what they mean:


subject - The subject number, 1-30
activity - The activity as a factor:

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
